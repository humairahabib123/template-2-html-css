        <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence, or AI for short, is best described as programming computers to think and predict
            like
            humans can. It’s not just for robots — AI encompasses anything from speech recognition to solution planning
            to
            machine learning. AI allow computers to discover patterns, whether they are supervised by humans or
            unsupervised. The goal of this field in computer science is to create machines that are intelligent — ones
            that help us get what we need without extensive programming by human hands.

        <h1>Human Computer Interaction</h1>
        <p>Human Computer Interaction, or HCI, is exactly what is sounds like — it is the study of how humans and
            computers interact, and best practices for improving this interaction. This field of computer science
            combines with other fields such as Human Behavior, Psychology, and Design to create a fascinating look at
            humans’ use of computers.

        <h1>Information Security</h1>
        <p>Information Security (IS), also referred to as cybersecurity, deals with confidentiality, integrity, and
            availability of data, (abbreviated to CIA), and almost always deals with electronic data. Some use the
            Parkerian hexad which adds three new elements: possession, authenticity, and utility. It refers to the
            processes created and implemented to protect any form of private, confidential, and sensitive data from
            unauthorized use, access, modification or disruption.

        <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
        <p>
            Software engineering involves the building, designing, and engineering of computer applications and other
            systems. Those who choose careers in software engineering find themselves designing software, learning and
            working on computer code, managing computer systems, and implementation and oversight of various software
            applications. Topics of study may include software architecture, programming languages, and software
            testing.

        <h1>Database Administration</h1>
        <p>
            Database administration is all about, you guessed it, data! Data storage and organization are the two
            pillars of database administration, and it is also important for database administrators to keep internal
            data running smoothly and deal with data availability and security. This field may also involve backup and
            recovery, data reports, performance optimization, and even creation of databases. The most common industries
            where there is a need for database administration are in the financial, tech, and healthcare fields.

        <h1>Network Architecture</h1>
        <p>
            Network Architecture looks at the entire picture of the network as a whole, and tries to see how best to
            construct a network for a company. This field also involves analysis of data to determine network and
            technology requirements for a business, as well as network modeling, management, analysis, and budgeting.
            Network architects may design networks for local area networks or for wide area networks and intranets.

        <h1>Purpose:</h1>
        <p>
            i'm front-end web developer and my wish is to grow our young nation as great knowledge about technology. I
            want to
            see that our Pakistanis young should have great knowledge about technology and as you see above there are so
            many fields in Computer Science so, the individuals haave interest in anyone from many fields can get
            knowledge about it and help Pakistan to get success and also can earn money from having such skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compter Science have such a big field and there are many branches of it. According to my thoughts if someone
            haven't interest in this field but should have enough knowledege about basics of computers. And those who
            have interest in it i say to those person that they should need to enhance their knowledge and get the
            benefits from it for themselves and for their Country also.
